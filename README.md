# cypher-challenge

A cryptography code challenge

I built this app pretty much completely in raw Javascript, HTML, and CSS rather than using frameworks or libraries for both simplicity and the practice. The only external library I used was FileSaver.js to manage the text file download.
 
Sadly, although the code itself works perfectly the substitution algorithm based on letter frequency fails completely. The letters are accurately substituted using my code, but the result is highly inaccurate. I am working on implementing a higher level algorithm using word substitution, but since I knew nothing about cryptography before starting this project, itâ€™s a bit of a learning curve.
 
I have left more notations than I normally would in my JS just to show my approach and where I worked through each step before moving on to the next.
 
There is a live version of the app here:  http://mandym.com/cypher/
